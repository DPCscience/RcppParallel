Boost.SIMD
==========

- Make it easy for client packages to use Boost.SIMD (plugin? Also need LinkingTo: BH?)
- Enable 'parallelFor', 'parallelReduce'-style calls to SIMD
- See 'Wizard' (http://www.evanmiller.org/) for inspiration
- Need to think about NA (idiom that handled NA)
- Setting of compiler flags for CRAN
- Don't overlap with Armadillo, Eigen
