Description: Interface to Intel TBB (Threading Building Blocks), a C++ library
   for parallel programming. It uses C++ templates to provide powerful parallel 
   functionality that works with common programming patterns. For example, 
   the parallel_for construct can be used to convert the work of a standard 
   serial "for"" loop into a parallel one and the parallel_reduce construct
   can be used for accumulating aggregate or other values.
