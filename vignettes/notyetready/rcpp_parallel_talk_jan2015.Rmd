# Intro

## One View on Parallel Computing

# R

## CRAN Task View on HPC

\framesubtitle{Lots of existing work to draw from}

- Package snow by Tierney et al a trailblazer
- Package Rmpi equally important
- Packages multicore nee parallel help Windows (l)users
- Hundreds of applications
- It just works for _data parallel_ tasks

## Rcpp: Early Days

In the fairly early days of Rcpp, we also put out RInside as a simple C++
class wrapper around the R-embedding API.

It got one clever patch taking this (ie: R wrapped in C++ with its own
`main()` and sticking it into MPI. 

## Rcpp: More recently

Rcpp has gotten fairly easy to use.  

OpenMP is easy to use and widely
supported (on suitable OS / compiler combinations).

So we added support.  Use not as wide-spread. Errors have commonality:
calling back into R.


## RcppParallel

Easy-to-use-wrapper around Intel TBB (and TinyThreads where no TBB)

Users still attempt to use R objects...
