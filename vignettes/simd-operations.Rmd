Modern CPU processors are built with new, extended instruction sets that optimize for certain operations. A class of these allow for vectorized operations, called Single Instruction / Multiple Data (SIMD) instructions. Although modern compilers will use these instructions when possible, it is often not possible for the compiler to reason about whether or not a particular block of code can be executed using SIMD instructions.

`Boost.SIMD` is a (proposed) C++ header-only libary, that makes it possible to explicitly request the use of SIMD instructions when possible, while falling back to regular scalar operations if not. `RcppParallel` wraps and exposes this library for use with R vectors.

Here's a quick example of how we might compute the sum of elements in a vector, using `Boost.SIMD`. 

```{r, engine='Rcpp'}
// [[Rcpp::depends(RcppParallel)]]
#include <RcppParallel.h>
#include <Rcpp.h>

using namespace RcppParallel;
using namespace Rcpp;

// Define a functor -- a C++ class which defines a 'function call'
// operator -- to perform the addition of two pieces of data.
struct add_two {
   template <typename T>
   T operator()(const T& lhs, const T& rhs) {
      return lhs + rhs;
   }
};

// [[Rcpp::export]]
double simd_sum(NumericVector x) {
   return simd::accumulate(x, 0.0, add_two());
}
```

```{r}
data <- rnorm(1024 * 1000)
all.equal(simd_sum(data), sum(data))
if (requireNamespace("microbenchmark", quietly = TRUE)) {
   microbenchmark::microbenchmark(sum(data), simd_sum(data))
}
```

Boost.SIMD provides two primary abstractions for the implementation of SIMD algorithms:

- `simd::accumulate()`, for vector -> scalar transformations, and
- `simd::transform()`,  for vector -> vector transformations.

These functions operate like their `std::` counterparts, but expect a functor with a templated call operator. By making the call operator templated, `Boost.SIMD` can generate code using its own optimized SIMD functions when appropriate, and fall back to a default implementation (based on the types provided) when not.
